This is the subset of CP437 that the default Windows console is capable
of displaying correctly: all of it except for characters 16 and 17, ie
U+25B6 BLACK RIGHT-POINTING TRIANGLE and U+25C0 BLACK LEFT-POINTING
TRIANGLE, which incidentally are also the only characters not in WGL-4.

Without #ifdefing, all default glyphs must come from this set.  If win32
console is excluded, it should be safe to use WGL-4 instead, as no one
sane can expected to run a ttyrec viewer or a ssh client from there.
